## About Me
I am currently pursuing an **M.Tech in VLSI Design** at **VIT Vellore**, with strong academic and project experience in **ASIC front-end and back-end design**, **low-power IC techniques**, and **semiconductor device simulations**.  
My expertise spans RTL coding in Verilog/SystemVerilog, ASIC physical design flows at the 14nm node, and advanced device modeling using TCAD.  
I am passionate about applying my skills to build efficient, high-performance semiconductor solutions and open to opportunities in **VLSI design and optimization**.
